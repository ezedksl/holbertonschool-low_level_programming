# C Language Introduction

C is a procedural programming language. It was initially developed by Dennis Ritchie in the year 1972. It was mainly developed as a system programming language to write an operating system. The main features of C language include low-level access to memory, a simple set of keywords, and clean style, these features make C language suitable for system programmings like an operating system or compiler development.
Many later languages have borrowed syntax/features directly or indirectly from C language. Like syntax of Java, PHP, JavaScript, and many other languages are mainly based on C language. C++ is nearly a superset of C language (There are few programs that may compile in C, but not in C++).

### Low-level programming & Algorithm - Hatching out

* [0x00. C - Hello, World](https://github.com/ezedksl/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x00-hello_world)
> **0-isupper.c** - script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.
> **1. Compiler** - script that compiles a C file but does not link.
> **2. Assembler** - script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file
> **3. Name** - script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun
> **4. Hello, puts** - C program that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.
> **5. Hello, printf** - C program that prints exactly with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,, followed by a new line.
> **6. Size is not grandeur, and territory does not make a nation** - C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.
> **7. What happens when you type gcc main.c**
> **8. Intel** - script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file.
> **9. UNIX is basically a simple operating system, but you have to be a genius to understand the simplicity**
